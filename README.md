While digging in my hard drive I found an old project that I developed during a math (statistics and probabilities) course of my BSc. The original code was written in Java, but since I've switched to Python I've decided to port it and get a sense about the feeling of porting an application from one programming language to another. It was actually a good experience.

I've decided to publish the project just in case it is useful to somebody. It is called montecarlo because it demonstrates how to use the Monte Carlo methods in problem solving. Two different problems are solved. The first one is related with approximating the mathematical number Ï€; the second calculates the probability of having `N` (where `N` is a variable) orders of faulty chips during a factory production.
